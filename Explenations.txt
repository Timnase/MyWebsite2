display modes:
1. block: it blocks the hole row where such character is found.
we can define its width but we cant layout beside it anything.

2. inline: like its name, these characters are laid out one besides the other.
we cant define the width of the block around such character.

3. inline-block: the best of both worlds. so the characters align one besides the other. and we can change the width,

4. none: as its name, no display. pay attention: it does not keep its place in the inline
it is as it was never written.
**another option is to use visibility: witch keeps the block space but un-visualizes the block content



position:
1. relative. (options- left, right, bottom, top): we can move the character relatively
to its initional position, so left: 20 px will actually move the object right with 20px space from the left initial location.
2. absolute: is relative to its farther: moves in the direction u expect, (but remember who is the farther).
3. fixed: keeps it fixed in place even when scrolling up and down. (good for side bars and so).
